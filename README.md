# [Investigating the genetic and environmental aetiologies of non-suicidal and suicidal self-harm: a twin study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/investigating-the-genetic-and-environmental-aetiologies-of-nonsuicidal-and-suicidal-selfharm-a-twin-study/42E64877BFE4EAD8C92C1E8A3CBDE86F)


This is one of my PhD project, where I employed twin modelling, a structural equation modelling approach to study the aetiology of self-harm and its genetic and environmental relationship with other mental health conditions. 

Applyiong this method on a longitudinal twin dataset with ~9000 twins, we found that suicidal and non-suicidal self-harm have high genetic correlation, and their share the same degree of genetic and environmental relationships with a range of mental health conditions.
